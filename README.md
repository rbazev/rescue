## Contents

* `rescue_theory.py`: Code for performing numerical calculations of probability of rescue, population size, number of beneficial mutations, and waiting time for a beneficial mutation.

* `rescue_simulations.py`: Code for simulating population dynamics under evolutionary rescue without tracking individual beneficial mutations.

* `rescue_mutation_simulations.py`: Code for simulating population dynamics under evolutionary rescue while tracking individual beneficial mutations.

* `prob_rescue.ipynb`: Code to generate Figure 1 showing the effect of different parameter combinations on the probability of rescue from new mutations.

* `pop_size.ipynb`: Code to generate Figure 2 showing the effect of different parameter combinations on the growth of a rescued population.

* `mutations.ipynb`: Code to generate Figure 3 showing the effect of different parameter combinations on the waiting time for a rescuing mutation.
