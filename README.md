In press at *Mathematical Biosciences*.

## Contents

* `README.md`: This file.

* `rescue_theory.py`: Code to run numerical calculations of probability of rescue, population size, number of beneficial mutations, and waiting time for a beneficial mutation.

* `rescue_simulations.py`: Code to run simulations of the evolutionary rescue model.

* `prob_rescue.ipynb`: Code to generate Figure 1 showing the effect of different parameters on the probability of rescue from new mutations.

* `pop_size.ipynb`: Code to generate Figure 2 showing the effect of different parameters on the growth of a rescued population.
